# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to use New York City Citibike data and extract key information that would inform the decision of investing into a similar program in DesMoines.
An analysis was conducted and is now presented to showcase our findings. For the purpose of the analysis, we looked at the month of August 2019.

## Results: 
Using **Python** (Jupyter Notebook) and **Tableau**, as the main visualization tool, we were able to identify some key findings:

1. There were a total of **2,344,224** ride in August 2019 in New York.

2. Out of these trips, **1,530,272** were made by males and **588,431** were made by females.

3. Most of the trips started at the heart of Manhattan (around Grand Central Terminal), indicating that tourists and commuters contribute a lot to the Citibike usage.

4. Most trips were less than one (1) hour each. In fact, **146, 752 trips** were around **5 min** in duration, which is the highest recorded lenght of time for Citibike usage that month.

5. Most trips were performed by males, but it is significant to note the a lot of users also preferred to not specify their gender.

6. In the weekday, the hours of 12:00 AM to 04:00 AM see the least amount of traffic, and can therefore be used as maintenance hours. Additionally, the peak time for Citibike usage seems to coincide with "rush-hour" time (6–10 am  and 4–7 pm).

7. When looking at the data by gender, we can once again see that most of the male usage matches the overall trip usage pattern. This indicates that the prime users of Citibike are males.

8. We can also see that Citibike has a good subscriber base, since they are the category of customers recording the most trips, especially males.

## Summary: 
In order to replicate the same program as CitiBike in New York, based on the August 2019 data and the breakdown of users, the city of DesMoines will need to ensure that they create a subscription program, ensure that there are enough bike locations near point of interests, public transportation hub, and professional area, and that the demographic reflects an healthy male population. This steps would ensure, a good foundation for success.
